    "## Introduction to Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "***Everything in Python is an object***\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a phrase that is often heard but not a lot of time do we go into understanding what this actually means. This tutorial aims to add some sense and understanding to this phrase by introducing Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python to understand the Python data model. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='oop'></a>\n",
    "### What is OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports all the basic features of OOP language. Object-oriented programming has some advantages as a design pattern: Development is fast and cheap, with good software maintainability. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='invest'></a>\n",
    "### The learning investment\n",
    "\n",
    "So **do you need you the object-oriented approach in all your future code?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple answer is no, at the end of the day it is up to you. Working in this way can provide many benefits but just as with other design patterns, users are required to apply clean code for it to have those benefits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is not a object-oriented programming language through-and-through as it does not support all kinds of object-oriented principles (eg. encapsulation). Therefore the design pattern you choose to continue using after is just that, a choice and it is yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately the goal of this tutorial is to give you enough information to learn about how to use object-oriented programming as a style of coding in Python so that you can understand the Python data model. Knowing this will give you a better grounding for how lists, tuples, dictionaries, pandas dataframes and other Python objects work. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also very possible that you will be required to make your own class in the future, be it a helper class for a command line app or a custom model for `sklearn`. \n",
    "\n",
    "So whether it's **understanding the Python data model** or having confidence to **make your own classes supporting Python programming paradigms**: this is an investment worth taking.\n",
